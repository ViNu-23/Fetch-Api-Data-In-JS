# Fetch API Data with Promises and Async/Await
## Overview
This repository contains a JavaScript script demonstrating the use of the Fetch API to retrieve data from a remote server using both Promises and the modern Async/Await syntax. The script showcases two different approaches to handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

Features
Promises Method:

The script includes a function that uses the traditional Promise syntax to make a fetch request and handle the response.
Demonstrates how to handle success and error cases using the .then() and .catch() methods.
Async/Await Method:

The script introduces an alternative approach using the more modern Async/Await syntax for asynchronous operations.
Illustrates how to define an asynchronous function with the async keyword and use the await keyword to pause execution until the Promise is resolved or rejected.
Error Handling:

Both methods include error handling to gracefully manage any issues that may occur during the fetch operation.
Errors are logged to the console with informative messages for debugging purposes.
Usage Example:

The script provides a simple example of how to call both the Promise-based and Async/Await-based functions to fetch data.
